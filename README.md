Future development of the application

Convenient delivery â€“ FriendlyLend will encourage personal handover of clothes and accessories. Users will be able to arrange meetings at convenient locations such as universities, cafes, gyms, and other places. This will streamline the process and avoid additional shipping costs.
ðŸŽ² Bidding for clothes â€“ In the future, there may be an option for bidding, where the price of an item can exceed the symbolic 1 euro. Users whose fashion items are most desired and most rented will be recognized as true trendsetters in the community. This will distinguish them as people with good style and a sense of fashion, motivating them to share even more from their wardrobe.
